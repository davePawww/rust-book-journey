fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
// Compiling the program
// rustc main.rs

// Running the program
// ./main

// main is the entry point of the program - it is a special function: it is the always first code that runs in every executable Rust program.

// rust uses 4 spaces to indent code.

// adding ! in println makes it a Rust macro.
// without ! it would be a function.               -- what is the difference between a macro and a function?
