fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}

// rustc main.rs - to compile the program.
// ./main - to run the program.

// main is the entry point of the program - it is a special function: it is the always first code that runs in every executable Rust program.

// rust uses 4 spaces to indent code.
